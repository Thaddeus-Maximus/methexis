This is a meditation on a certain strand of thought that has been on my mind for years now. It's bugging me, and urging me to reconsider my direction in life.

It's in the collective unconscious, and it's breaking through to its conscious levels, whether by those driven to mailbombing (Kacynski), schizophrenia (Terry Davis) or more reasoned voices. Here are some key selections I've found, with a bit of a recency bias:

- C.S. Lewis - The Abolition of Man
- Theodore Kacynski - Industrial Society and Its Future
- Guillaume Faye - Archeofuturism
- [The Cappadocian House Proposal by Joel Barstad](https://byzantinela.com/cappadocian-house-proposal/)
- St. Maximus the Confessor - On The Cosmic Mystery of Jesus Christ

# Return to Monke

You may be familiar with Kacynski's seemingly anarcho-primitivist leanings:

"Thus the power process is disrupted in our society through a deficiency of real goals and a deficiency of autonomy in pursuit of goals." - Kacynski

"When motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase man's freedom. They took no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didn't want one, and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster than the walking man... Since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment, shopping areas and recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the automobile for transportation" - Kacynski

Lewis echoes the latter of this quite frankly:

"what we call Man’s power over nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men with nature as its instrument."

This isn't really a new idea, of course, and ironically. Straight from Ecclesiastes:

"I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind." (Ecclesiastes 1:14, NIV)

# Archeofuturism

Guillaume Faye's Archeofuturism is... well, you could call it bold, or you could just call it edgy. I think many edgy teenagers are worth listening to.

"On the other hand, a museum-like admiration of the past is elicited- of a fossilised and neutralized past- as a clever way of promoting sterile traditionalism. What matters is for the masterpieces of the past not to serve as a means for reawakening talent in the present or future." - Faye

"Why should everyone want to reach Mars, travel on 500 kph bullet-trains, fly in supersonic jets, live to the age of one hundred through translplants and antibiotics, chat online, watch TV dramas, etc.? This fever only belongs to certain peoples and groups, and cannot be extended to humanity as a whole... the members of traditional societies where little money circulates are neither poorer nor less happy than New Yorkers or Parisans with all their modern conveniences, even if... they might have lower life expectancies." - Faye

"This return to archaic questions baffles modern intellectuals, who expound on... inanities. The attraction towards the insignificant and the memorialising of the past is a characteristic of dying modernity. Modernity is backward-looking, whereas archaism is futurist."

# Barstad's Cappadocian House

The Cappadocian House Proposal by Joel Barstad echoes many things I have felt as strong reactions to modernity:

"I added and insistent thirst to overcome certain conventional and traditional oppositions, among them the separation of intelligence from sanctity, of study from worship, of the liberal arts from the arts of subsistence, of the speculative from the practical and creative. How could I hope to know the Word without bowing before Him in worship and then giving Him a birth in the materiality of my life? And how could I be happy unless that birth took place here, in my life?"

"Apart from Christ the sacrifices demanded by nature are vain and alienating; in him they become salvific."

# Methexis

But lastly, the sage words of our father amongst the saints, Maximus the Confessor, writes:

"... there is relative knowledge, rooted only in reason and ideas, and lacking in the kind of experiential perception of what one knows through active engagement; such relative knowledge is what we use to order our affairs in our present life. On the other hand, there is that truly authentic knowledge, gained only by actual exerience, apart from reason and ideas, which provies a total perception of the known object through a participation (μέθεξις; methexis) by grace. By this latter knowledge, we attain, in the future state, the supernatural deification (θέωσις; theosis) that remains unceasingly in effect. They say that the relative knowledge based on reason and ideas can motivate our desire for the participative knowledge acquired by active engagement."

A year ago the message of "active participation in creation" came to me. A strong calling and desire to help others do so.

Earlier this year upon meditation of the idea of θέωσις I coined the idea "technology for theosis" (perhaps more properly, technology oriented towards theosis).

When I read that word "μέθεξις"- I knew that this was the same message for the third time.

The participation of a lower to its higher. Actively.

We find ourselves at a crossroads and a pivotal time. (Of course- what point in history is not pivotal?) For many the bubble seems to keep getting bigger with no particular pop in sight. The fabric of the neoliberal world order is like some polymer- it seems so thin and easy to rip, yet it isn't. It's still here. But when we break through, it's going to be a brittle failure- no malleability and ductility.
