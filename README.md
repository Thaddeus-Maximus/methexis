# ΜΕΘΕΞΙΣ
A working thesis for a new endeavor. The modern world is at a crossroads, as it always is- we've built much technology, but the question is where to go from here?

This text is not aimed at pontificating or producing particularly new profound ideas. The aim of this text is to grapple with the existing ideas and begin putting them into practice.

Thoughts and engagement welcomed.
