# THEOLOGY OF TECHNOLOGY
A working thesis for a new endeavor. The modern world is at a crossroads, as it always is- we've built much technology, but the question is where to go from here? Many have posited new ideas on where next, and even more have expressed severe disdain at the modern condition and beg for a return to a traditional outlook within the modern physical condition.

This text is not aimed at pontificating or producing particularly new profound ideas. The aim of this text is to grapple with the existing ideas and begin putting them into practice.

Thoughts and engagement welcomed.

The actual paper here will be written in LaTeX, because whatever is written in LaTeX is profound and authoratative.
